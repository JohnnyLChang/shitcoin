# Blockchain CTF Challenge

This is a CTF challenge to learn something about Bitcoin like blockchains. The blockchain creates a simple cryptocurrency. Your target is to steal money in the cryptocurrency to buy the flag.

## Setup

Install the dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the challenge server:

```
./shop.py
```

## Instructions

Connect to the challenge on port 8327. This will open the flag shop. While the flag shop is open, you can connect with the blockchain client to the port shown by the flag shop:

```
./client.py <server_ip> <blockchain_node_port>
```

The client will start receiving blocks. To give commands to the client, connect to its RPC interface:

```
nc 127.0.0.1 7839
```

You will want to create an address, start mining to it to receive some money and then make some transactions, similar to this:

```
>> new_address
159c16d08380c847542b82fdf746858239d1f8e635c63608c37fa4cc58769908
>> start_mining 159c16d08380c847542b82fdf746858239d1f8e635c63608c37fa4cc58769908
>> show_wallet
159c16d08380c847542b82fdf746858239d1f8e635c63608c37fa4cc58769908: 500000

Transaction sent to miners.
```

Note that this client mined 500000 STC before checking the wallet, which might take you some time. The flag shop's node can mine 1024 times faster than the client to prevent a 51% attack, so you might want to find a faster way to get money.

Have fun!

## Bugs and so on

There are probably many unintended bugs left. If you find some unintended bugs, please report them or send a pull request. This code was written quickly without much planning.
